- upon running the tutorial code the first thing i noticed was the robot stopped completely at all turns.
- no buzzer is playing, so that means no turns are detected.
- i checked for any code where the robot's speed is set to 0 that might be accidentally called. i tried checking if the robot was finishing, but the buzzer isn't playing so i know that can't be true.
- i tried changing the threshold for detection to 300 instead of 400. that didn't work and i feel silly
- i'm going to try and see where it stops by putting buzzers at debug points in the code such as at the very beginning of the get_intersection_type function

- i notice that when I have the buzzer play at the very beginning of the get_intersection_type function, it doesn't play while the buzzer from the initial
if(line_on_left || line_on_right) {
    in the loop is still playing.
    . so the function is not being called (which would mean something later on in the function is stalling the robot). i'm having trouble with the detection at all.
    - 

- when putting a buzzer  at the very beginning of this loop:
 while(line_on_left || line_on_right){
    
      buzzer.play("O6c32d32e32f32g32");
    linesensors.read(sensor_vals);
    line_on_left = sensor_vals[0] > THRESHOLD;
    line_on_right = sensor_vals[5] > THRESHOLD;

    line_on_left_ever = line_on_left || line_on_left_ever;
    line_on_right_ever = line_on_right || line_on_right_ever;

    finish_counter++;
    if(finish_counter > 60){
      buzzer.play("O6c32d32e32f32g32");
      return FINISH;
    }
  }
- it does not buzz when it should. so this means this while loop is never being entered (i was testing on an intersection at the time)
- to remedy this i tried having the robot slow down when trying to get intersection types.. but that didn't work because the speed had become 0 anyway (oops) so it didn't affect it.

- next i looked at the turn functions. i went back and compared it to old code to see if anything was vastly different.. it was a little different but i realized the get_intersection_type function wasn't even working



- I also tried adjusting the threshold to 300 and 450 instead of 400, but it only changes how late or early the robot halts completely (which I understand)
